# EZElectronics

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart to buy them, see the history of their past purchases, leave reviews of the products they have purchased, and see the reviews of the available products. Admins can assess the status of the system and manage data through delete operations.
